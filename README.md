# **PocketEncryption** (Currently on hold, I am working on my degree, will probably pick this up again in a few months)

Development source of an app designed to provide offline encryption services for any text, initially, with later possibility to expand into file and folder encryption later.

The app can currently store your data in encrypted files, behind a master password that you need to set, which can be changed.
The app is intuitive and even has help text and user feedback which tell you exactly what is going on and what you need to do to use it.

The app's backbone is pretty much done now and can be used. Version 1.0 is coming after I optimise some slow code and test it.

## Currently working on:

- Testing

- Implement option to use internet temporarily to send recovery email?

## TODO:

- Implement periodic backups to internal shared storage, which can be disabled, along with exporting and importing them manually.

## Done:

- App is multithreaded everywhere it was useful

- Code cleanup and refactoring (2022.06.29)

- Romanian translation

- Generated release v0.5 for closed testing

- User warnings

- Resettable master password

- Easy-use, encrypted file r/w utilities

- Implemented easy-to-use encryption utilities using modern algorithms

- Encryption key secure storage using the Android Key Store

- Theming, partially

- UI (will be updated more in time)
